# Twack 

A simple Slack clone, built with Twilio, Angular 5 and Electron.  Enter a username, create a channel, join the channel and chat away!  

To run, see the instructions below.  You must edit your `environment` config files in this application to point at a backend.  See [Twack Server](https://github.com/cfsilence/twack-server) for a compatible backend.

The following is included from the [Angular Electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron) project.

# Introduction

Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 5(+) and Electron (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v5.2.5
- Angular-CLI v1.6.4
- Electron v1.8.2
- Electron Builder v20.0.4

With this sample, you can :

- Run your app in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run your app in a production environment
- Package your app into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.


If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.  
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start  

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.  
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.  
You can desactivate "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Manage your environment variables

- Using local variables :  `npm start` or `cross-env ENV=local npm start`
- Using development variables :  `cross-env ENV=dev npm start`
- Using production variables  :  `cross-env ENV=rod npm start`

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run ng:serve`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds your application and start electron
|`npm run electron:linux`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system |
|`npm run electron:windows`| On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems |
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Mac |

**Your application is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser (WITHOUT HOT RELOAD ACTUALLY...) ? You can do it with `npm run ng:serve`.  
Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
